Substitute
Normal
Status
pow: 0, acc: true, pp: 10, pri: 0, target: self
The user takes 1/4 of its maximum HP, rounded down, and puts it into a substitute to take its place in battle. The substitute has 1 HP plus the HP used to create it, and is removed once enough damage is inflicted on it or 255 damage is inflicted at once, or if the user switches out or faints. Until the substitute is broken, it receives damage from all attacks made by the opposing Pokemon and shields the user from status effects and stat stage changes caused by the opponent, unless the effect is Disable, Leech Seed, sleep, primary paralysis, or secondary confusion and the user's substitute did not break. The user still takes normal damage from status effects while behind its substitute, unless the effect is confusion damage, which is applied to the opposing Pokemon's substitute instead. If the substitute breaks during a multi-hit attack, the attack ends. Fails if the user does not have enough HP remaining to create a substitute, or if it already has a substitute. The user will create a substitute and then faint if its current HP is exactly 1/4 of its maximum HP.

The user spends two to five turns using this move. Has a 3/8 chance to last two or three turns, and a 1/8 chance to last four or five turns. The damage calculated for the first turn is used for every other turn. The user cannot select a move and the target cannot execute a move during the effect, but both may switch out. If the user switches out, the target remains unable to execute a move during that turn. If the target switches out, the user uses this move again automatically, and if it had 0 PP at the time, it becomes 63. If the user or the target switch out, or the user is prevented from moving, the effect ends. This move can prevent the target from moving even if it has type immunity, but will not deal damage.
